Goal-Achievement-Tool
=====================
This tool was developed to assist in reaching goals. 
When the executable is run it initializes a data file.
The user enters a list of goals and the application helps the user build a tree of tasks related to achieving that goal
The user can set target dates and using the MasterMind tab - brainstorm ideas for acheiving the goal. 
The user also establishes a reward for the completed goal. 

The Critical 6 tab allows the user to choose the 6 most critical tasks to acheiving this goal. 
The order of all tasks can be changed by the user.
As a task is completed, it is transferred to the completed tab with date and time of completion. 

Multiple goals can be tracked.

The idea is to help achieve a BIG goal by breaking it down into little steps. When all of the little steps are completed
the goal is attained!

This aplication was written with 3 language selections - English, Spanish and French.
